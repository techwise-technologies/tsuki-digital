### Alpine Linux ?

Small. Simple. Secure.

Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox. It compiles all user-space binaries as position-independent executables with stack-smashing protection.

Because of its small size, it is commonly used in containers providing quick boot-up times.

### Debian Linux ?

The Universal Operating System.

Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel. 

The project is coordinated over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the Debian Project Leader and three foundational documents: the Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution, and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. 

New distributions are updated continually, and the next candidate is released after a time-based freeze.

### Docker Containers ? 

Developing apps today requires so much more than writing code. Multiple languages, frameworks, architectures and discontinuous interfaces between tools for each lifecycle stage creates enormous complexity. 

Docker simplifies and accelerates workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project.

### Docker-Compose ?

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application's services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

### Nginx ?

Nginx is a small, lightweight web server. It runs on some of the top one million web servers. In particular, nginx is well-suited to a high traffic site. Its lightweight nature, compared to Apache, means an nginx server can run in a much smaller memory footprint. This makes it the web server of choice for people looking to squeeze the most performance out of a VPS solution.

### ProtonMail ?

ProtonMail is an end-to-end encrypted email service founded in 2013 in Geneva. ProtonMail uses client-side encryption to protect email content and user data before they are sent to ProtonMail servers, unlike other common email providers such as Gmail and Hotmail.

ProtonMail Bridge is an open source application that enables the integration of your ProtonMail account with popular email clients, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Apple Mail. Bridge runs in the background by seamlessly encrypting and decrypting messages as they enter and leave your computer. The app is compatible with most email clients supporting IMAP and SMTP protocols.
